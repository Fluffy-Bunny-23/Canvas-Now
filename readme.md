# Canvas-Now Extension

## Prompt

```text
I have trouble switching classes in canvas for school, so Make a Chromium extension that when clicked will go to the page on canvas that is for my current class. I also want an options page when right clicked to have settings at the subpath /config and make a link in config to go to the schedule, which will be at the extension then /schedule. On the schedule page, it will look like the screenshot attached, but each class will be dragged and dropped into the background schedule. Tell it to use the Canvas LMS API to get the URLs and class names to drag from the left of the screen onto the time slots in the schedule on the /schedule screen. Make all of your plans then put them into a md file for how you will execute them. Do not make all of the changes now, but make a very in-depth md file for how to do everything to make the project. That should be called plan.md in a folder named .ai. If you want to make any other files to help the AI that will code it, put them in md files under the .ai/ subdirectory. At the project dir also make a readme.md file that explains what the extension does. Do not use emojis for that. Also add a license. Make it a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license in a way that will work in GitHub.
